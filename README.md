# Cell-DEVS model of People Evacuating a Room

## Compiling the model
Open a terminal in the main directory with the makefile and enter the command, "make simulator". This will create a bin and a build folder.

## Running the model
Open a terminal in the bin folder and enter commands like this, "./MAIN ../Scenario1.json 10". This command will run the model with scenario 1 for 10 time steps. You can select a different scenario and run it for different amounts of time, though the longest scenario, which is 3, only runs for about 21 time steps before it finishes. To read the log result of the simulation enter the folder "simulation_results" and select the .csv file named "evac". The most recent simulation log is always called "evac.csv".
# Asymmetric Cell-DEVS Wildfire Spread Model
**SYSC 5104/4906G — Term Project, Carleton University, April 2026**
**Author:** Manthan Patel

## Overview
An Asymmetric Cell-DEVS wildfire simulation using Cadmium v2. Each cell has a
unique terrain-derived neighbourhood where vicinity weights encode wind direction,
Rothermel slope, fuel-type adjacency, and firebreak blocking — pre-computed by
a QGIS data pipeline and stored in the scenario JSON topology.

## Prerequisites
- CMake 3.10+, GCC 13+ (C++17)
- Python 3 with: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, pillow

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Get Cadmium v2
git clone https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere/cadmium_v2.git cadmium_v2

# 2. Build
bash build_sim.sh

# 3. Generate all 5 scenarios (QGIS pipeline)
python3 generate_scenarios.py

# 4. Run all scenarios + visualize
bash run_all_scenarios.sh
```

## Run Individual Scenario
```bash
./build/wildfire_sim scenarios/scenario_calm.json 500 42
# Args: <scenario.json> <sim_time> [rng_seed]
# Output: grid_log.csv
```

## Visualize
```bash
LOG_FILE=results/grid_log_calm.csv SCENARIO=calm python3 visualize_wildfire.py
# Output: results/wildfire_calm.gif
```

## Scenarios
| File | Description | Wind | Notes |
|------|-------------|------|-------|
| scenario_calm.json | Uniform boreal forest | 0 km/h | Baseline radial spread |
| scenario_windy.json | Grass/shrub | 35 km/h E | Asymmetric east corridor |
| scenario_firebreak.json | Forest + river + road | 10 km/h | Topology-based containment |
| scenario_urban.json | Forest + urban | 15 km/h S | Road gap breach |
| scenario_fortmcmurray.json | Real terrain | 65 km/h SW | May 3 2016 reconstruction |

## Cell States
| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Non-flammable (water/road) |
| 1 | Unburned |
| 2 | Burning |
| 3 | Ash |
