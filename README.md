# Asymmetric Cell-DEVS Wildfire Simulation

A physics‑informed wildfire spread model built using the **Asymmetric Cell‑DEVS** formalism and executed on the **Cadmium v2** discrete‑event simulation engine.  
The model integrates heterogeneous terrain, wind forcing, fuel structure, and probabilistic ember spotting to reproduce real wildfire behavior.

---

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Asymmetric Topology:** Wind and slope effects embedded directly into directional vicinity weights.  
- **Ember Spotting:** Sparse long‑range edges simulate river‑crossing and extreme‑wind ignition.  
- **Real Geospatial Data:**  
  - **NRCan CDEM** — elevation & slope  
  - **NLCMS‑2015** — land‑cover & fuel classification  
- **High‑Performance Execution:** Built on **Cadmium v2** for asynchronous, event‑driven simulation.

## 🛠 Prerequisites & Environment Setup

This project was developed on the `devsim` server. A Python virtual environment is used to avoid system‑level dependency issues.

### 1. Python Environment

Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install visualization dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas

🏃 Running the Simulation
From the project root:

bash
# Usage:
# ./build/wildfire_sim <scenario_file> <time_steps> <seed>

./build/wildfire_sim scenario.json 500 42
scenario.json — grid, fuel, weather, and topology configuration

500 — total simulation steps

42 — random seed for reproducibility

📊 Visualization & Analysis
After simulation, a grid_log.csv file is generated in /build.

To generate the animated GIF and statistical plots:

bash
# Ensure virtual environment is active
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run visualization
python3 visualize_wildfire.py
Outputs include:

wildfire_spread.gif — animated fire progression

PNG charts — rate of spread, active burning cells, cumulative burn area

🧪 Validated Scenarios
The model has been tested across multiple wildfire behaviors:

Scenario 1 — Calm: Isotropic spread under no‑wind conditions

Scenario 3 — Firebreak: Complete containment by a river (no spotting)

Scenario 4 — Moderate Wind: Spotting occurs but cannot sustain a breach

Scenario 7 — Fort McMurray: Reproduces the 2016 Horse River breach under 65 km/h winds
